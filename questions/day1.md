# Challenge

We have a microservices architecture with each service in its own repository. We want to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab that accomplishes the following:

- Each service should have its own pipeline for building, testing, and deploying.
- When a service's pipeline succeeds, it should trigger an integration test pipeline that tests the interaction between all the services.
- We also want to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage the environments that we deploy to.

Your task is to design a solution for this setup. Please provide a high-level overview of how you would structure the pipelines and any `.gitlab-ci.yml` configurations you think would be necessary. Also, explain how you would manage the environments using IaC.

This challenge tests the candidate's understanding of GitLab CI/CD, microservices architecture, pipeline dependencies, and Infrastructure as Code. It's a real-world scenario that they might encounter in a job, and it requires both knowledge and creativity to solve.
