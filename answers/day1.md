# Solution

## Overview

Given a microservices architecture where each service is in its own repository, we can leverage GitLab's powerful CI/CD capabilities to create a robust pipeline for building, testing, and deploying each service. We can also use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage the environments we deploy to.

## Pipeline Structure

Each service would have its own `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defining the stages of its pipeline. A typical pipeline might include stages for building the service, running unit tests, and deploying the service to a staging environment.

Here's a simplified example of what a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file might look like:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script: echo "Building the service..."

test:
  stage: test
  script: echo "Running tests..."

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script: echo "Deploying the service..."
